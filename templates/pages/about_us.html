<h2>About Play2Learn</h2>
<p>Play2Learn helps students build fluency with quick, fun practice games. We started this
project to make math and vocabulary drills feel like play.</p>

<h3>What we offer</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Math Facts</strong> – one-minute arithmetic sprints.</li>
  <li><strong>Anagram Hunt</strong> – unscramble letters to form words.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Who’s behind it</h3>
<p>Hi! I’m {{ request.user.get_username|default:"A happy student developer" }}. I built Play2Learn
as a learning project and to share with classmates, friends, and family. Feedback is very welcome!</p>
